Commoneer
=========

...is a Kohana module that extends the default helpers, providing additional functionality.

Commoneer adds functions I often find myself using such as formatting a date for MYSQL.

Install
=======

Copy to Kohana's modules folder and rename to commoneer. Add a line to application/bootstrap.php to enable it.

Documentation
=============

None so far. The functions are commented with PhpDoc tough.
