# Notify

Many Applications and Modules need to deliver messages to the user, and there is no uniformity on how that is done.
It's the developer's job to tweek all those notifications and views of different modules to make, if possible, a unified look.

This is where Notify comes in.

Notify is a simple Kohana 3 module designed to capture messages from different methods and modules to be displayed later with a unified look and feel.
