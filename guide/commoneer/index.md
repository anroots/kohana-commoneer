# Commoneer

Commoneer provides commonly used helpers, methods and classes that the author saw fit to add to Kohana.

The module extends several Kohana's built-in helpers, providing additional functions and behaviours.

Minimal Kohana Userguide documentation is provided as well as Phpdoc style comments.
